# Inventory-App

Hello, this is a simple inventory system developed solely for the Shopify's recuirement challenge.
<br/><br/>
I wish I had more time to work on this project, I just figured about this job opportunity 18 January, 2022, and I had less than a day to complete it.

The application's back-end is developed using <b>Java</b>, and the front-end is <b>HTML-CSS-JavaScript</b>.
All the api calls are called by the JavaScript functions.
The application runs on an in-memory database, which means all database is going to be deleted upon server restart.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
In order to run this application, it is required to have Java 11.x or any late Java development kits, as well as Maven installed.

Once the enviroment is set, the application can run through the following command. (in the project's root folder)
<br/><br/>For MacOS<code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>  - For Windows <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code> 

It is aswell recommended to have IntelliJ IDEA to easily re-compile the files.
